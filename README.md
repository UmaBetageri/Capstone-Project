## Analysis and experimental forecasting of earthquakes in the US from 2000-23

The project covers an in-depth analysis of earthquake patterns in the United States, spanning area, year, and the top five earthquakes recorded in the country from 2000 to Feb 2023. The study involves collecting and analysing historical data, as well as employing experimental approaches to forecast future earthquakes. For time series forecasting of earthquake data, this study makes use of ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and LSTM models. The goal is to get a better knowledge of the origins and effects of seismic activity, as well as to develop forecasting tools to assist in mitigating the effects of earthquakes on infrastructure and communities. The study's findings will help to improve understanding of earthquake trends in the United States, as well as support the creation of effective disaster mitigation and management policies and methods.

In conclusion, the analysis of earthquake data from the USGS has provided meaningful insights into the frequency, location, and magnitude of seismic activity in various parts of the US. We were able to identify the most seismically active places and comprehend the factors that lead to earthquake occurrence by studying the data.

The project also focuses on exploring the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for forecasting the earthquakes. We use the word experimental because as we saw that predicting the earthquake is highly unlikely but understanding the trend and patterns of previous earthquakes can give guidance on how to prepare better for the future occurrences. Clustering identified the group of locations having similar magnitude earthquakes and some clusters contained the locations with highest magnitude. This information can be used to track the seismic activity of such regions more closely. 

The time-series models like Exponential Smoothing and LSTM showed the capability of identifying the trend in data to some extent and even made predictions on unseen data. Using the high compute systems and more data can help improve the modelsâ€™ performance and the results can be used to proactively take actions.
